   NOVELTY - A silicide metal layer (130) is formed on a semiconductor substrate (100). The layer (130) is removed using cleaning compound and etching compound if a predetermined period of time lapses after forming the layer. The native oxide layer formed on uppermost surface of the electrode in the substrate is removed by performing pre-cleaning process on the substrate. Another silicide metal layer is formed on the substrate repeatedly after removing native oxide layer. A silicide layer is subsequently formed on the substrate after forming the metal silicide layer.    USE - Formation of silicide in semiconductor device.    ADVANTAGE - The formation of silicide prevents the occurrence of liquid marks due to oxidation reaction at the interface of the semiconductor substrate in contact with the silicide metal layer and prevents silicide defects due to excessive delay.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A silicide metal layer is formed on a semiconductor substrate in which a gate electrode (108), device isolation layer (102) and source and/or drain region (114) are formed. The layer (130) is removed using cleaning compound and etching compound if a predetermined period of time lapses after forming the layer. The native oxide layer formed on uppermost surface of the electrode is removed by performing pre-cleaning process on the substrate. Another silicide metal layer is formed on the substrate repeatedly after removing native oxide layer. A silicide layer is subsequently formed on the substrate after forming the metal silicide layer.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the silicide formed on a semiconductor device.
