   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a transistor structure (15) over a semiconductor substrate (10). The substrate formed with the structure is annealed at a pressure of approximately 7-40 standard atmospheres and a temperature of 200-600 degrees Celsius. An isolation layer (18) is formed over an entire surface of the substrate before annealing. A metallic compound layer (22) is formed over the substrate by forming a dielectric intermediate layer (25) over the substrate. A protective layer (30) is formed over the compound layer, and a color filter layer (41) is formed over the protective layer.    USE - Method for manufacturing an image sensor (claimed) i.e. complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor.    ADVANTAGE - The semiconductor substrate formed with the transistor structure is annealed at the pressure of approximately 7-40 standard atmospheres and the temperature of 200-600 degrees Celsius, thus reducing dark current and stabilizing components of the image sensor, thus improving product performance, characteristics, reliability and efficiency of the image sensor.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for an image sensor including a transistor structure.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor.
