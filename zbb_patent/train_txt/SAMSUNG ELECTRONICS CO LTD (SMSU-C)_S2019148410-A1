   NOVELTY - The method involves providing (102) several fins such that a first portion of each of fins is covered by a mask and a second portion of each of the fins is exposed by the mask, while the fins are silicon (Si) fins. The process of performing an anneal in a volume-increasing ambient at one anneal temperature of 100 degrees C - 600 degrees C, is carried out (104). The second portion of each of fins is exposed during the anneal such that the second portion of each of fins undergoes a volume expansion.    USE - Method for providing semiconductor device (claimed).    ADVANTAGE - Since the second portion of each of fins undergoes a volume expansion, the geometry of the fins can be tailored without altering fabrication or photolithography of the semiconductor devices. By selectively exposing portions of the fins to hydrogen anneal, the volume of the portions of the fins can be selectively increased. The dielectric layer is formed in such a way that the height is reduced to allow the desired amount of the fins to protrude above the top surface of the dielectric layer. Since the top source/drain regions of the fins in the finFET is expanded, the provision of a larger volume for the top source drain process can be possible, so that performance of the finFET can be improved, while reducing parasitic resistance.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the semiconductor device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flow diagram illustrating the process for selectively increasing the volume of a portion of a fin structure in a semiconductor device.
