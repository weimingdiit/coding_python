   NOVELTY - The method involves providing a channel layer (312) having an active layer. An anneal is performed upon the top surface of the active layer with a low temperature. An aluminum nitride (AlN) film is deposited film over the top surface of the active layer through an atomic layer deposition (ALD). An anneal is performed upon the AlN film with a high temperature, to diffuse aluminum (Al) atoms from the AlN film into the active layer. A ratio of the concentration of Al in the AlN film to the concentration of Al in the active layer is from about 1.1 to 2.5.    USE - Method for forming semiconductor structure e.g. III-V high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure for use in power applications.    ADVANTAGE - The HEMT device with a low on-resistance, as well as low current collapse and improved interface trap density and linear drain current degradation, is realized.
