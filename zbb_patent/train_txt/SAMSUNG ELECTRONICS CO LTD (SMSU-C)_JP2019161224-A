   NOVELTY - Formation of oxide layer involves forming a material layer (a1) on a semiconductor substrate, annealing (s1) in inert atmosphere, and then annealing (s2) in oxidative atmosphere. The material layer (a1) contains a polysiloxane material containing silyl bonds.    USE - Formation of oxide layer used for manufacturing semiconductor device (claimed).    ADVANTAGE - The method enables formation of oxide layer having excellent quality, by annealing at low temperature. The semiconductor device using the oxide layer has excellent reliability.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Formation of oxide layer involves forming a material layer (a1) on a semiconductor substrate, annealing (s1) in inert atmosphere, and then annealing (s2) in oxidative atmosphere. The material layer (a1) contains a polysiloxane material containing silyl (Si-H1 , Si-H2 and Si-H3) bonds. The polysiloxane material contains 40-90% silyl (Si-H2) bonds. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for manufacture of semiconductor device.
