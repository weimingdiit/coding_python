   NOVELTY - The method involves forming side wall insulating film (17) in the side of gate electrode (13) on semiconductor substrate (11). An impurity is introduced in both sides of gate electrode. An insulating film (20) is formed. The impurity is diffused by annealing insulating film in a state which covered the gate electrode, side wall insulating film and semiconductor substrate, and source/drain diffused layer (18) is formed. The stress value is changed after the annealing process.    USE - Manufacturing method of semiconductor device (claimed) such as PMOSFET and NMOSFET.    ADVANTAGE - The leakage current of the semiconductor device can be reduced. The thickness of the gate insulating film can be reduced.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for semiconductor device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawings show the sectional views of the semiconductor device.
