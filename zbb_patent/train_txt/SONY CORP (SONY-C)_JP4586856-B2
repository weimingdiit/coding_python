   NOVELTY - The element (1) has a semiconductor stacked structure provided with two conductivity type layers (11, 13) and a light absorbing layer (12). An oxidation layer (19) comprises a non-oxidation region (19A) and an oxidation region (19B) in plane direction of the light absorbing layer or between the conductivity type layer (11) and the light absorbing layer. Dielectric constant of the oxidation region is smaller than the dielectric constant of the light absorbing layer. The non-oxidation region is provided in a center of a region facing a light incidence plane.    USE - Semiconductor light receiving element for an optical communication system (claimed).    ADVANTAGE - The thickness of the light absorbing layer reduces capacity during traveling of carriers, thus minimizing the traveling time of the carriers.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:    (1) a semiconductor light receiving element manufacturing method    (2) an optical communication system.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor light receiving element.
