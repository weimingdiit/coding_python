   NOVELTY - The laser (1) has a laminated structure (20) which is formed by laminating lower distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) layer (11), a lower spacer layer (14), an active layer (15), a top spacer layer (16), a current constriction layer (17), a top DBR layer (18) and a contact layer (19). The lower DBR layer has an oxidation region (30) which is positioned opposite to an electric current constriction and injection regions (17A,17B) of the current constriction layer, so as to stabilize the polarization direction of the laser beam to particular direction.    USE - Surface emitting type semiconductor laser such as aluminum gallium arsenide type compound semiconductor laser for digital copier and printer. Can also be used in gallium indium phosphide type compound semiconductor laser, aluminum gallium indium phosphide type compound semiconductor laser, indium gallium arsenide type compound semiconductor laser, gallium indium phosphide type compound semiconductor laser, indium phosphide type compound semiconductor laser, gallium nitride type compound semiconductor laser, gallium indium nitride type compound semiconductor laser and gallium indium nitride arsenic type compound semiconductor laser.    ADVANTAGE - The polarization direction of the laser beam can be stabilized efficiently, and the high-powered semiconductor laser can be manufactures simply and inexpensively.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for method of manufacturing surface emitting type semiconductor laser.
