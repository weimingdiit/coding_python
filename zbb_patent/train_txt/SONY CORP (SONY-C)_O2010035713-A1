   NOVELTY - A semiconductor device has a microcrystalline-silicon film or polycrystalline-silicon film with particle size of 10-50 nm formed on an amorphous silicon film by preforming several annealing treatments.    USE - Semiconductor device is used for display device (claimed) e.g. liquid crystal display device and organic electroluminescent device. Can also be used for notebook personal computer, mobile telephone, digital camera, video camera and portable terminal device.    ADVANTAGE - The generation of display non-uniformity in display device having semiconductor device is prevented.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:    (1) manufacture of semiconductor;    (2) semiconductor manufacturing apparatus; and    (3) display device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows an explanatory view of laser annealing treatment. (Drawing includes non-English language text)    Gate film (12)    Gate insulating film (13)    Semiconductor layer (14)    Buffer layer (15)    Optical absorption layer (16)
