   NOVELTY - A semiconductive seamless belt contains 1-20 weight parts (wt.pts) of silica with respect to 100 wt.pts of rubber materials. The coagulated particle diameter of silica is 100 mum or less.    USE - As transfer belt for transferring toner image to photoreceptor in image forming device e.g. electrophotographic system, electrophotographic copier, copy paper, etc. The transfer belt is also used in electrophotographic basic principle device e.g. laser printer and facsimile.    ADVANTAGE - The method enables production of semiconductor seamless belt free of fine cracks.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the manufacture of semiconductive seamless belt by:    (a) mixing 5-50 wt.pts of carbon black having primary particle diameter of 15-50 nm with respect to 100 wt.pts of rubber materials to obtain primary masterbatch;    (b) adding 1-20 wt.pts of silica to the primary masterbatch and mixing to obtain secondary masterbatch;    (c) adding cross-linking agent to the secondary masterbatch and mixing to obtain non-vulcanized rubber composition; and    (d) forming the belt by molding the non-vulcanized rubber composition.
