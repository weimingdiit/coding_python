   NOVELTY - A heat resistant film consists of polyether ether ketone having crystallinity degree of 25% or less, measured by densimetry.    USE - Heat resistant film is used for semiconductive belt (claimed), intermediate transfer belt, and conveying belt for color image forming apparatus. Can also be used for electronic component, flexible printed substrate and integrated circuit carrier tape.    ADVANTAGE - The heat resistant film has excellent bend-proof fatigability, flame retardance, rigidity, electrical insulation property and chemical-resistance.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for manufacture of the heat resistant film.
