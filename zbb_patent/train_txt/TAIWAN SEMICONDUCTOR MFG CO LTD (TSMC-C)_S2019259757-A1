   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a first semiconductor layer over a substrate (210). A second semiconductor layer is formed over the first semiconductor layer. A first portion of the first semiconductor layer is selectively removed by performing oxidation process on the first semiconductor layer and the second semiconductor layer such that the second semiconductor layer is oxidized and the first portion of the first semiconductor layer is oxidized. The oxidized second semiconductor layer and the oxidized first portion of the first semiconductor layer are selectively removed. A gate stack is formed around a second portion of the first semiconductor layer, where the gate stack is part of a PMOS transistor and a NMOS transistor.    USE - Method for fabricating a semiconductor device.    ADVANTAGE - The method enables performing scaling down process, increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs, designing or modifying processes and structures and covering a surface of a MOS region with a patterned hard mask so as to prevent the MOS region from being affected during processes carried out in regions simultaneously. The method enables performing chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process to remove excessive dielectric materials and planarize a top surface of isolation regions.
