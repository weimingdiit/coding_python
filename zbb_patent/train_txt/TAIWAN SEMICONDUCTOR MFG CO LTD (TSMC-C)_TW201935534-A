   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a first high-k dielectric layer (112) on a semiconductor substrate (102) including a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. A second high-k dielectric layer (114) is formed on the first high-k dielectric layer such that the second high-k dielectric layer comprises a material different from a material of the first high-k dielectric layer. The first and second high-k dielectric layers are annealed and are inter-diffused. A gate electrode is formed over the second high-k dielectric layer. A source/drain region is formed in the semiconductor substrate after annealing the first and second high-k dielectric layers. The semiconductor substrate is provided in contact with the aluminum-free high-k dielectric layer.    USE - Method for manufacturing semiconductor device such as integrated circuit (IC).    ADVANTAGE - The inter-diffusion between aluminum oxide layer and GaAs substrate is prevented by interposing another high-k dielectric layer between the aluminum oxide layer and GaAs substrate, so as to improve thermal stability of an interface between high-k dielectrics and semiconductor. The gate dielectric formed of multiple high-k materials exhibits less absorption of moisture compared to the gate dielectric formed of a single high-k material.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a semiconductor device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device.
