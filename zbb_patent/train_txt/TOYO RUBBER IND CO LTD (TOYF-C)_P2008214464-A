   NOVELTY - A polyether sulfone-type resin containing an electroconductive filler is molded into film-form, and an electrode pair is contacted with the front and back of the polyether sulfone-type resin film. A high-voltage application processing of the film is carried out, and semiconductive belt is manufactured.    USE - Manufacture of semiconductive belt used as intermediate transfer belt of color image forming apparatus, and transfer conveying belt.    ADVANTAGE - The semiconductive belt having favorable electrical property, is efficiently manufactured.
