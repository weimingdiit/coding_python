   NOVELTY - The method (500) involves forming a dielectric layer, forming a carbon layer over the dielectric layer, forming a metal layer over the carbon layer, performing an anneal process, in which portion of the carbon layer is transformed into graphene during the anneal process, removing the metal layer after performing the anneal process, and etching the graphene (110) to define a channel and a source/drain region from the graphene.    USE - Method for forming semiconductor device (claimed) e.g., transistor.    ADVANTAGE - By forming at least one of the first in-plane gate, the second in- plane gate, the first active area, or the second active area from graphene, a height difference between the graphene channel and at least one of the first in-plane gate, the second in-plane gate, the first active area, or the second active area is reduced. By replacing at least one of the first in-plane gate, the second in-plane gate, the first active area, or the second active area with graphene simplifies the fabrication process for the semiconductor device.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a semiconductor device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the top down view schematic view of the semiconductor device.
