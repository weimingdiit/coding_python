   NOVELTY - Forming a metal line, comprises: preparing semiconductor substrate (101) having first metal line; performing an oxidation process with respect to the first metal line; performing an oxide removal process to remove an oxide of the first metal line generated in the oxidation process; forming an etch stop layer on the metal line; forming an interlayer dielectric layer on the first metal line including the etch stop layer, and forming damascene pattern on the interlayer dielectric layer; and forming second metal line (160), which is connected with the first metal line, in the damascene pattern.    USE - The process is useful for forming metal line (claimed), of an image sensor.    ADVANTAGE - The process improves light receiving characteristic of photodiode.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure represents a cross-sectional view for explaining a process for forming a metal line of an image sensor.
