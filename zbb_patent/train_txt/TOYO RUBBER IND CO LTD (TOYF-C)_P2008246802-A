   NOVELTY - The method involves providing a polyether sulfone type-resin film (1) containing an electroconductive filler, and performing plasma processing to the film, where the polyether sulfone type-resin film is suspended by a set of rotating rolls (3). Cylinder shape film is extruded from an extrusion molding apparatus that includes a circular dice. Plasma is irradiated to the film such that air carrier gas is made to undergo atmospheric pressure in a plasma exposure nozzle (2) by a plasma generator.    USE - Method for manufacturing a semiconductive belt i.e. intermediate transfer belt, for an image forming device utilized for forming an image.    ADVANTAGE - The method facilitates efficient manufacture of the semi conductive belt with suppressed in-plane variation of an electrical resistance value.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top view representing outline of a plasma generator.
