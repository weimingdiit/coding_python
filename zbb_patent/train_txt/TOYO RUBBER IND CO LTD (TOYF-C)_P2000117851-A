   NOVELTY - A seamless semiconductive rubber belt having a volume resistivity of ten to the part of 4 to ten to the part of 12 ohms.cm is produced.    USE - The method produces the semiconductive rubber belt for use in the transfer part of an image-forming device, including a copying machine, printer, facsimile machine and finds its application in an electrostatic photographic process.    ADVANTAGE - The belt has more uniform thickness in molding. The result reduces manhours for grinding. Less variation in electrical resistance is observed. The method eliminates the need for covering the die with the tube of the unvulcanized rubber.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The production comprises:    (a) plasticizing a unvulcanized rubber composition precursor; extruding the precursor by means of an extruder;    (b) covering in a layered shape the outer surface of a cylindrical die with the precursor with the die moving in the direction at right angles to the extruding direction of the precursor to form an unvulcanized rubber belt molded part;    (c) vulcanzing the molded part.
