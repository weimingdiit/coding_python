   NOVELTY - The method involves forming metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor (1) having impurity diffused layer (1a) and gate electrode (1b) on semiconductor substrate so that sum of formation areas of diffused layer and gate electrode differ corresponding to primary and secondary regions (A1,A2) of substrate. The dummy impurity diffused layer (2) and gate electrode (3) are included in substrate region by performing annealing treatment using infrared radiation with respect to corresponding substrate region.    USE - Method for manufacturing semiconductor device (claimed).    ADVANTAGE - Since dummy impurity diffused layer and gate electrode are included in substrate region by performing annealing treatment using infrared radiation with respect to substrate region, characteristics variation of transistor and change of threshold value of transistor can be performed with less number of processes.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for semiconductor device.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawings show the plan views of the semiconductor substrate.
