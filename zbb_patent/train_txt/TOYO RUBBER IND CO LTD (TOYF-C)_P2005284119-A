   NOVELTY - A lubrication-layer formation coating material is applied on surface of an elastic base material layer and dried at 20-90degreesC, to form a lubrication layer on elastic base material layer. Thus, manufacture of semiconductive seamless belt is carried out.    USE - For manufacturing semiconductive seamless belt used as transfer belt (intermediate-transfer belt, conveyance transfer belt) in image forming device such as copier, laser printer and facsimile.    ADVANTAGE - The method provides semiconductive seamless belt that favorably transports and supplies the product. The dispersion in volume resistivity of the belt is suppressed. The lubrication layer is excellent in lubricity, strength, durability, abrasion resistance, flexibility and adhesion with respect to elastic base material.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure is a graph showing the drying temperature of coat for forming surface lubrication layer, and over-time change of volume resistivity of semiconductive seamless belt.
