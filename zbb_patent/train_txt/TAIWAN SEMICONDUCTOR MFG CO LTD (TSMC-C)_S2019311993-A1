   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a low-k dielectric layer (20) over a substrate. A conductive wiring is embedded in the low-k dielectric layer. The conductive wiring is thermally soaked in a gas with silicon hydride (SiH)-bonds to form a barrier layer (46) on the conductive wiring. The thermal soaking occurs in a non-plasma environment. The barrier layer comprises a silicide. A decontamination process is performed prior to the thermal soaking the conductive wiring.    USE - Method of forming semiconductor structure in integrated circuits.    ADVANTAGE - The thermal soaking of copper line in gas, prevents silicon diffusing into deep portions of copper line. Thus, copper silicide is formed only at the surface portion of the copper line, while avoiding the excess resistance degradation of copper line. The metal cap layer improves the reliability of the interconnect structure by reducing copper surface migration.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a cross-sectional view of the barrier layer that is formed on copper line.
