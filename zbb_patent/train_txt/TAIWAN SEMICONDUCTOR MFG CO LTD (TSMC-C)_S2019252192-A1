   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a junction region in a substrate. A solid material (104) comprising gallium is heated to form a gaseous substance in a first chamber, and a generated rate of the gaseous substance is controlled by controlling a first temperature and a first pressure of the first chamber. The gaseous substance is ionized to produce a first type of ions. The first type of ions are implanted into the junction region. The junction region implanted by the first type of ions is annealed.    USE - Method for forming semiconductor structure of semiconductor device.    ADVANTAGE - The method provides better abruptness, better shallow junction depth, and better sheet resistance and better device performance.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows the schematic view of a heating chamber for implementing a method for applying a pre-amorphization-implant (PAI) in a semiconductor structure.
