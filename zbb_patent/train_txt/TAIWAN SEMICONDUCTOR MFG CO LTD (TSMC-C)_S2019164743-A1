   NOVELTY - The method involves forming a layer using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, and annealing the layer in a nitrogen environment by annealing the layer for a first period of time while increasing an annealing temperature from a first temperature to a second temperature, annealing the layer at the second temperature for a second period of time, and annealing the layer at a third period of time while decreasing annealing temperature from the second temperature. The layer is formed by flowing a silicon source precursor, flowing a carbon and nitrogen source precursor, and flowing an oxygen source precursor.    USE - Forming method of dielectric features.    ADVANTAGE - Enables a dielectric film that has a lower k-value, strong plasma and etch chemistry resistivity, and high density against physical bombardment in subsequent processes. Provides a dielectric features with improved resistance against etching chemistry, plasma damage, and physical bombardment in subsequent processes while maintaining low k-value for target capacitance efficiency.
