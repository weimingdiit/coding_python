   NOVELTY - The semiconductive seamless belt is a laminated structure containing an elastic layer (I) provided on the outer surface of a highly rigid resin base material, and an elastic layer (II) provided on the inner surface of the base material. The Young's modulus of the base material is 100 MPa or more.    USE - For electrophotographic image forming device such as color copier, laser printer and facsimile.    ADVANTAGE - The elongation deformation of the seamless belt by tension stress at the time of driving of the belt, is reduced.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows the sectional drawing of the structure of the mandrel and the coating formation of the seamless belt.    mandrel (5)    joint portion (12a)    eamless belt layer (26)
