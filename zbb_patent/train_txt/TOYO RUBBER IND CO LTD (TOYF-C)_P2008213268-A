   NOVELTY - A polyether sulfone type resin containing electroconductive filler is formed in a film (1) after which corona discharge treatment of the film is performed. The treatment is performed by placing the film between discharge and counter electrodes (2,3) in the state in which the film contacts the counter electrode through a conductive resin layer.    USE - Semiconductor belt manufacture method for color image forming device. Can be used as an intermediate transfer belt, conveyance belt, etc.    ADVANTAGE - By performing corona discharge treatment of the polyether sulfone type resin film, the voltage dependence of the electrical resistance of the belt is minimized. In-plane variation of the resistance value is suppressed.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a top view of a corona discharge device used during semiconductor belt manufacture.
