   NOVELTY - The forming method involves forming a first metal layer (208) in an opening defined by a dielectric layer (204). The second metal layer (212) is formed over the first metal layer. The semiconductor structure is annealed to form a metal oxide layer (220) from the first metal layer after forming the second metal layer. A metal plug (228) is formed in the opening over the metal oxide layer. The semiconductor structure is annealed for forming a silicide layer (218) from the second metal layer. The dielectric layer is formed over a substrate.    USE - Forming method for a semiconductor structure.    ADVANTAGE - The semiconductor structure is annealed for forming a silicide layer from the second metal layer, and hence reduces the strain on a silicon lattice in the substrate.
